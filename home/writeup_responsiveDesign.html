                I went into this one with an intentional design, to the point where I designed a rough look on Figma before starting to build out the page. Since it was around Valentines Day, I thought about a future where everytihng was measured around Valentines day, kind of like B.C. or A.D. but like B.V.D. or A.V.D. (Before Valentines Day/After Valentines Day). I enjoyed the design of the site so much that I thought it would be a waste to leave it for just this project and modeled the whole site off of this assignment.
