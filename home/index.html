            <h1>MEDIATED EXTENSION OF SELF</h1>
            <h3>March 24, 2021</h3>
            <body>
                From Marx to McLuhan and beyond the idea that the technology - in the broadest sense - is what augments the human and makes us stand out among the rest of the animal kingdom has permeated the discussion about the relationships between ourselves and our media. Tools augment our physical ability, information storage and disseminaation techniques extend the capacity of our minds. But in all those conversations the focus has been distinctly outward, to the world outside of our selves and our bodies. 

                For this project I am going to explore how digital technology extends and augments my senses, my bodies and my visions of myself. I'll start by creating devices that would allow me to collect data from my immediate surroundings; that would serve as extensions of my body and sensory organs. I will organize and distill this data to a meaningful set and explore ways of presenting it that could uncover possible underlying patterns.

            <h1>DIGITAL DREAM SPACE</h1>
            <h3>February 24, 2021</h3>
            <body>
                With this project I'll begin the exploration of virtual environments. I'll look at how digital spaces can emulate or build upon the physical realm, and I'll take on the spaces that are not possible or not necessary in the material world, but present us with some exciting creative possibilities in the digital medium.

                The project is not centered around a specific tool, but is rather meant to be an overview of (some) conventions, constraints, and opportunities in the digital 3D space.

                The outcome of this project will be an environment I can call my digital home on the Web. Consider not only the elements that I would like to include but also the kinds of activities that my environment would be suitable for.
