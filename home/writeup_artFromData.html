            <h1>THE DATA</h1>
            <body>
                The data was recorded every minute or so into the Adafruit IO. Each data stream within the color data was relatively similar with the color leaning more into red than anything else. The light data was since I wasn't moving between different rooms too often with the cake box. When analyzing the data, I cut the red data values in half to highlight more of the blues and yellows I saw througout the day.
                The gaps in data were from a few days of not collecting data.

                Before working directly with the data, I decided to use some sample values and try to create an image. This was to avoid overcomplicating the process and making sure one thing worked before moving to the next.

        <h2>I MADE A MISTAKE BUT IT WORKED</h2>
        <body>
            In the process of moving from OpenProcessing to Visual Studio, I started changing some of the values of the image without realizing and ended up with a very different looking visualization. I ended up changing the ellipse equation when rendering individual waves as well as the values of x and dx when calculating the individual waves. This caused the image to change from a sinWave image to a more layered visual.

            The resulting image is this:
